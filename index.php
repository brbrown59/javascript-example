		<p id="color" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut()">Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [about protective goggles] Fine, I'll wear 'em. But I'll look like an idiot. Zo : I should think you'd be used to that, sir. Jayne Cobb: Shepherd Book once said to me, "If you can't do something smart, do something right." Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: We're going to need paint. We're going to need red paint. Jayne Cobb: [as Mal's talking to the Vault Guard] MAL! Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Every heist he's gotta start yellin' my name! Dr. Simon Tam: [deciding to leave the ship] River, do you want to stay with them? River Tam: It isn't safe. Dr. Simon Tam: No. I fear it isn't safe any more.

			Fanty: Do you know that girl?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I really don't.
			Dr. Simon Tam: But I think when they triggered you, it somehow brought this up. This memory.  River Tam: It isn't mine. The memory, it isn't mine. And I shouldn't have to carry it. It isn't mine. Don't make me sleep again.  Dr. Simon Tam: I won't. I won't.  River Tam: Put a bullet to me. Bullet in the brain pan. Squish.  Dr. Simon Tam: Don't say that! Not ever. We'll get through this.  River Tam: Things are going to get much, much worse.
			The Operative: Where are you hiding, little girl?
			The Operative: Secrets are not my concern. Keeping them is.
